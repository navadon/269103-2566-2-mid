2. After one and a half years as an ISNE student, what recommendations would you make to prospective ISNE students? (Your answer must be at least 50 words long)

**Answer:** 

*TYPE_YOUR_ANSWER_HERE*
I would recommend the new ISNE students to make sure to pay attention to Cal 1. Since Cal 1 is the thoughest course to pass. And to not be sad if in cal 1 you didnt get a good grade, since the prof. 
make the grades really hard to deal with. Also to dont rely much on ChatGPT since right now we are in university, and the goal is to learn and polish our skills, but if you just use ChatGPT to do the work 
for you, you wont be using the opportunity to the fullest!
